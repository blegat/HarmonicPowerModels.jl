# Circuit Representation

## Network Representation

Mapping between any dimensionality, e.g., time, power harmonics, operating 
states, and the corresponding networks of the circuit.

## Physical Representation

Mapping between 

- four-wire
- symmetrical
- balanced

## Mathematical Representation

- rectangular current-voltage (ivr)

## Problem Representation

- power flow
- state estimation
- optimal power flow
- hosting capacity
