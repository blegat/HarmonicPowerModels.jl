# Harmonic Hosting Capacity

## Goal of the Problem Formulation

The harmonic hosting capacity problem aims at determining the maximum amount of 
harmonic current that may be injected in order for a subset of the following 
technical limits not to be exceeded:
- individual harmonic voltage distortion limits
- total harmonic voltage distortion limits
- rms voltage limits
